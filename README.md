Description:
------------

This card game 'War' is a group project created by Abdullah Mallah, Eszter Kalm√°r and Hampus Gunnarsson.

The basic idea is that the game is played by two players using a standard deck of 52 cards.
The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

Players start by evenly dividing the deck between themselves and then each player turns over their top card. 
The player with the highest card wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.

If there is a tie, a "war" occurs where each player puts three cards face down and then turns over another card.
The player with the highest card wins all the cards in the tie. The game continues until one player has won all the cards.

Features of our game:(abdullah)
--------------------
When the game starts the user/s can choose to play the game, see scores, change a name which is stored in the txt
file or exit the game.
After choosing to play the game the user can choose to play against computer and if so the user can choose the level
of intelligence of the computer which are: Level1 random cards, level2 random cards but the first card is the highest
card in the deck eccept 1 and level3 random cards but the first two cards are the highest cards in the deck eccept 1,
or against another player.
Each human player can flipp, use hack to steal 1 or 2 cards from the opponent, continue the game automatically untill
a winner is found or exit the game.

Installing the game:
------------------------
Start by downloading the repo, either as a zip-file (check the web page for download options) or using git clone.

How to run the game:(hampus)
----------------------------


How to create and run the virtual environment:(hampus)
------------------------------------------------------
Create and use the virtual venv:
--------------------------------
make venv

If you use a Python installation on Window, then activate like this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

. .venv/Scripts/activate

If you use a Python installation on Mac/Linux, then activate like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

. .venv/bin/activate


Do not forget to deactivate when you are done using:
---------------------------------------------------
deactivate


How to install make and chocolati:(hampus)
------------------------------------------


How to do testings:(abdullah)
----------------
After installing gitbash, chocolati, make on the computer  and creating the vertual environment in the game folder which
you downloaded from git hub, you need to install the requirenments.txt on the venv, you do that by oppening git bash in
directory of the game folder then activate venv by using (". .venv/Scripts/activate") then ("make install").
After installing what is in the requirenment.txt you can use:
1- ("make flake8") to test the game files using flake8
2- ("make pylint") to test the game files using pylint
3- ("make coverage") to do coverage
4- ("coverage report -m") to see the coverage report
5- ("make test") to run flake8, pylint tests and coverage at the same time
When you finish your tests and coverage you can close the vetual environment using ("deactivate").

How to generate documentation and html:(abdullah)
---------------------------------------
After oppening git bash in the game file and activating venv you need to use ("make doc") to generation documentation of the
game

How to generate uml:(abdullah)
-------------------
After opening the virtual environment in the path of the game and activate it and generating documentation you need to
use ("pip install graphviz") then ("pyreverse classes/*.py") then:
1- ("dot -Tpng classes.dot -o doc/pyreverse/classes.png") to generate uml of the classes.
2- ("dot -Tpng packages.dot -o doc/pyreverse/packages.png") to generate uml of packages.
If for some reason step 1 or 2 did not work then just create a folder with the name "doc" in the game folder then do step 1 and 2.

Other useful commands:
----------------------
1- ("make --version") to check if make is installed on your computer and which version is installed.
1- ("choco --version") to check if chocolati is installed on your computer and which version is installed.
